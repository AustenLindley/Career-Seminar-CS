                            If we receive a public tip from a social media account or from our forums, we will credit the username of the person with the news tip, unless otherwise specified in the communication. If we receive a private news tip via social media private message or via email, we will not credit you unless specifically asked. This means if you do not state either way in your email or private message that you would like to be credited, we will assume that you would not like to be credited. If you wish ANN to credit you, please include this in your message: "Please credit me as [name]." ANN's policy is to prioritize the privacy of our news tippers.
                            Before sending us a press release, make sure it is formatted properly and easy for us to import onto the site. While we have a press release area on ANN where we post press releases we receive via email, we do not post them if they: 1. are not attached to the email or are in the email body (outside links or Google Drive links do not count), 2. are not formatted properly, 3. rely heavily on images (we only post the text of the press release). If you're sending us a press release and not familiar with how to properly format a press release, read this. Press releases have a very specific format guide, and most people who think they know how to format them... don't. Press releases are only for companies, they aren't necessary if you're just submitting a news item.
                            <br>
                            Read our Embargo Policy
                            <br>
                            News and press release corrections should also be sent to newsroom.

                            Do not submit news in the forum

                            ANN's news staff does not (and couldn't possibly) read every single post in the forum. Send it to us by e-mail at the address above, we read that before doing the news every day.
